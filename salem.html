<h1>Salem</h1>
<p><h2>New Major Mechanic: Temperature</h2><br>
<br>
Each Season brings a new global temperature to the world of Salem.<br>
The Temperature inside a house is always nice and cozy.<br>
All clothing in Salem now has a Thermal factor. The higher the Thermal Stat, the more insulation it provides from Hypothermia.<br>
New Debuff: Hypothermia. Early Hypothermia barely slows the player. The amount the player is slowed increases the more severe the debuff gets. Once the player’s body temperature drops approx 7 degrees he will no longer be able to regenerate humors. Once a player’s body temperature drops 15 degrees he will begin to stop periodically and shiver/shake to raise his temperature. Once a player’s temperature drops 30 degrees he will become frozen until thawed.<br>
Players may now craft Wool Blankets. Wool blankets will increase body temperature of a player when they cuddle up in them.<br>
Players may now build Igloos. Igloos provide an ability to get warm in the snow.<br>
Drinking Broth will counter the effects of hypothermia.<br>
Alchemists may now craft a Thermoscope to check the temperature.<br>
<br>
Some quick hints about this: Don't walk in the snow without shoes. Try to at least wear SOMETHING on each slot of your body. Venturing up mountains and into high elevations with dramatically increase the speed in which you begin hypothermia.<br>
